## Short description

LiquiDa is a Mobile App which helps us to ensure availability and sustainable management of clean water.

### What's the problem?

The main problems we try to solev is :
* There is no platform to know the groundwater level
* No Platform to get  water quantity, quality at particular place
* Limited Awareness platform about clean water and sanitisation
* No interactive voice assistant
* No platform to know water quality testing labs


### How can technology help?

From intelligent solutions for small farmers to recycling showers, technology can make a significant impact on the availability of water and its consumption.
To encourage optimal water use by people and local governments and to incentivize water sustainability, we propose a platform for water data collection with API, Water Quality Testing Using IoT, Awareness about clean water sanitation.

### The idea
An Application which helps us to ensure availability and sustainable management of clean water. And we are trying to implemt a common platform for both the people and government authorities to upload data about water quality.
